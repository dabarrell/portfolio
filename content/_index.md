I am passionate about finding novel solutions to new problems, particularly in software engineering. I am excited by clean APIs, well-structured code, novel software architecture, well-tuned CI/CD pipelines, and working with intelligent, thoughtful people.

I have built up experience in a range of areas, from infrastructure engineering, backend development and software architecture to pitching and delivering projects, but I thrive where I can work with a team of people who share my passions, whether I am contributing code, or leading a projectâ€™s delivery.

Outside of work, I spend my time in the theatre, behind a music stand, or on the hockey field.
