At the intersection of technical leadership and product innovation, I thrive on building products that users love. What energises me is the challenge of bringing together people and technology to create something that becomes an indispensable part of its users' daily lives, whether I'm mentoring engineers, shaping product strategy, or putting hands to keyboard myself.

As an engineering manager at Buildkite, I lead the team behind the Pipelines product's infrastructure and core functionality â€“ technology that powers development workflows at some of the world's most demanding tech companies. Much of my focus has been on tackling crucial scaling challenges, working through significant technical hurdles while architecting for future growth. Beyond scaling, I've helped drive product direction through close collaboration with our users, ensuring our product provides the Lego bricks they need to craft solutions to their own internal challenges.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time either playing music or in the theatre. From early group piano lessons through studying bassoon alongside my undergraduate degree, music has been a constant in my life. Today, I get to work with incredible musicians, actors, and other creatives as a Music Director, Sound Designer, and Technical Director, having received awards for my work and opportunities to tour interstate.

These seemingly distinct worlds of technology and theatre share a foundation in what makes teams succeed. Whether it's a scramble towards opening night of a production or an engineering team pulling together to solve a critical outage, success depends on creative problem-solving, careful coordination, and the unique contributions of every person in the room.
