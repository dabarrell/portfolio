I am passionate about finding novel solutions to new problems, particularly in software engineering. I am excited by clean APIs, well-structured code, novel software architecture, well-tuned CI/CD pipelines, and working with intelligent, thoughtful people.

I have built up experience in a range of areas, from infrastructure engineering, backend development and software architecture to pitching and delivering projects, but I thrive where I can work with a team of people who share my passions, whether I am contributing code, or leading a projectâ€™s delivery.

Outside of work, I spend most of my time either playing music or in the theatre. Music is a constant in my life, from group piano lessons as a toddler, through studying bassoon alongside my undergraduate degree, to now, when I get to work with incredible musicians, actors, and other creatives as a Music Director. The collaborative nature of theatre, and the culmination of months of carefully coordinated work, make for some of the most rewarding experiences I have had.

My interest in theatre extends beyond music direction to production and technical aspects. I have worked as a theatre technician, and continue my involvement in shows as a technical director, sound designer, and stage manager.
