I am passionate about finding novel solutions to new problems, particularly in
the sphere of computer science and software engineering. I enjoy experimenting
with the constant stream of new tools, and am always looking to expand my skill
base.

The pursuit of varied projects and opportunities has allowed me to build
experience in a range of fields, from cluster computing and infrastructure
engineering to web and mobile application design and development; each new project
is a chance for me to try out new technologies, languages and tools. I am particularly
interested in machine learning and sofware reliability engineering.

Outside of work, I spend my time in the theatre, behind a music stand, or on
the hockey field.
