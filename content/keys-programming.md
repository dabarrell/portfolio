![Mainstage][mainstage-example]

Over the last decade, I have programmed keyboard patches for a number of shows, and offer these for hire.

- The Hunchback of Notre Dame
- In The Heights
- Little Shop of Horrors
- Spring Awakening
- The Drowsy Chaperone
- Heathers
- Sunset Boulevard

I also offer these services for new shows, so even if the show you're after isn't listed below, please feel free to get in touch. In addition to programming, I can also offer hire of gear, including keyboards, interfaces, and Mainstage rigs.

If you're interested in discussing further, reach out via the [contact][contact] page.
