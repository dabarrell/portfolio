    description: |-
      While software engineering provides plenty of entertainment at work, I spend my non-working hours moonlighting
      as a Music Director, Sound Designer, Technical Director, Stage Manager, and all-round theatre handyman. Alongside my degrees in
      science and engineering, I studied a Diploma in Music at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Bassoon.
      +++
      My previous music direction credits include Spring Awakening (twice), Little Shop of Horrors (twice again!), The Hunchback of Notre Dame,
      Sunset Boulevard, The Drowsy Chaperone, Heathers, and the Lyrebird Awards Ceremony. In 2022, I had the pleasure of working on In The
      Heights, for which I received Best Music Direction from both the Lyrebird Awards and the Music Theatre Guild of Victoria. I have worked
      as a Music Supervisor and Conductor on a number of smaller shows and concerts, as well as spending two years as the Choral Director of the Ormond Choir.
      +++
      I truly enjoy learning instruments, to the extent that my home is reminiscent of a high school music room. My strengths are
      bassoon, piano, and saxophone, though I am also proficient on bass, clarinet, oboe, and guitar, and am
      always trying to expand my skills further.
      +++
      As a theatre tech, my speciality is in sound design/engineering, complimented by experience in stage management, set construction,
      and lighting. I have a particular interest in keyboard programming, where sound design and music direction intersect.

      Listed below is a selection of my creative and theatrical experience.

              Music directors David Barrell and Ned Dixon have prepared the singers to a meticulously high standard such that the beauty
              of the massed singing is a standout attraction of the season. Further musical splendour is heard from the orchestra of 14
              musicians, conducted with absolute confidence by Barrell.

              OSMaD's Victorian premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame will leave you breathless with its state of the art production,
              worthy to grace the largest stages in the world! [...] Co-Music Directors David Barrell and Ned Dixon have created their own
              'place of miracles' in the orchestra pit with their extremely talented group of musicians. This difficult and relentless
              score is putty in their capable hands and sounds like the result of a much larger ensemble.

              This production raises local theatre to new 'heights' and may just be the best amateur show I've seen in 45 years!
              The consummate eleven piece band, under the Musical Direction of David Barrell, is tight and gives an impeccable performance.
