    description: |-
      While software engineering provides plenty of entertainment at work, I spend my non-working hours moonlighting
      as a Music Director, Technical Director, Stage Manager, and all-round theatre handyman. Alongside my degrees in
      science and engineering, I studied a Diploma in Music at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Bassoon.
      +++
      My previous music direction credits include Spring Awakening (twice), Little Shop of Horrors (twice again!), Sunset Boulevard,
      The Drowsy Chaperone, In The Heights, Heathers, and the Lyrebird Awards Ceremony. I have worked as a Music Supervisor and Conductor on
      a number of smaller shows, as well as spending two years as the Choral Director of the Ormond Choir.
      +++
      I truly enjoy learning instruments, to the extent that my home is reminiscent of a high school music room. My strengths are
      bassoon, piano, and saxophone, though I am also proficient on bass, clarinet, oboe, and guitar, and am
      always trying to expand my skills further.
      +++
      As a theatre tech, my speciality is in sound design/engineering, complimented by experience in stage management, set construction,
      and lighting. I have a particular interest in keyboard programming, where sound design and music direction intersect.
