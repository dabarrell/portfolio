            Culture Amp is the leading employee engagement and performance platform. We give leaders insights
            into their employee culture, allowing them to build on their strengths, and improve areas of opportunity.
            With a primary focus on culture, organisations can create environments where their employees feel engaged,
            which is the strongest leading indicator for the performance of the company as a whole.
            +++
            I began with a short stint on the Collective Intelligence team, drawing insights out of our customers’ survey results in order
            to help them collect, share and act on employee feedback. Since then, I have led and contributed to projects
            across the Engagement product as a Team and Delivery Lead.
            +++
            In my current joint role as a Senior Delivery Lead and Technical Lead, I’ve worked with cross-functional teams of various
            sizes (generally 6-12 people), collaborating across the product lifecycle from discovery to release, with my team’s wellbeing
            and growth as a primary concern. As a Mentor, I am also responsible for the performance, coaching, and development of a handful
            of direct reports.
            +++
            I was promoted to Senior Engineer in early 2020 and Lead Engineer in early 2022, and continue my involvement with the
            Site Reliability Engineering practice, handling infrastructure design and deployments for new services, providing SRE
            guidance to other engineers, and contributing to internal infrastructure tooling and a construct library built with
            AWS's Cloud Development Kit (CDK).
            +++
            Some of the projects I have led/contributed to include
            <ul>
            <li>a Reporting API, allowing our users to access and analyse the results of their surveys out of platform</li>
            <li>a rewrite of how we manage, translate and release survey templates across multiple data centres</li>
            <li>a refresh of our comments reporting experience</li>
            <li>the ability to automatically compare results against historical surveys across multiple dimensions</li>
            <li>various infrastructure uplifts</li>

            Teenyco aimed to improve ultrasound diagnostics in pregnancies, as well as
            foster an increased connection between parent and unborn child. Through
            various visualisation and digital fabrication techniques, we aimed to
            provide parents with a new way to connect with their babies, using methods
            such mesh extrapolation from 2D ultrasound images, allowing 3D printed tangible
            models to be produced.
            +++
            Access to the anonymised data obtained through this process also allowed
            us to investigate how machine learning can be used to pick up and point
            out potential anomalies to radiologists, reducing the high rate of ultrasound
            anomalies that currently go undetected.
            +++
            Teenyco won the $10,000 CMB Capital 'Best Startup' award at the Wade
            Institute's Final Pitch Night, as chosen by a panel including venture
            capitalists and established entrepreneurs.
