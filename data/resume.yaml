            In early 2020, I was promoted to Senior Engineer, with continuing responsibilities as
            a Delivery Lead. As a product organisation, we have explored and adapted the Shape
            Up methodology to suit our company. As a Delivery Lead working within this methodology,
            I lead a team of engineers to see a 'shaped' idea through from pitch to delivery.

            Culture Amp is the leading employee engagement and performance platform. We give leaders insights
            into their employee culture, allowing them to build on their strengths, and improve areas of opportunity.
            With a primary focus on culture, organisations can create environments where their employees feel engaged,
            which is the strongest leading indicator for the performance of the company as a whole.

            I started off working on the Collective Intelligence team to draw out insights
            from the results of our customers' surveys, to help those customers collect,
            share and act on employee feedback. This included a responsibility for deploying
            theoretical algorithms and frameworks developed by Data Scientists into
            production-quality and operational code, and for designing and delivering
            machine learning components of our product.

            From early 2019, I was Team Lead of the Comments team, responsible for all
            analytics and reporting related to comments left in the Culture Amp platform. In
            addition to leading a team of six, I contributed to the development of numerous
            new features, including comment clustering and automatic comment translation. I
            was also responsible for the infrastructure of the team's services.

            Teenyco aimed to improve ultrasound diagnostics in pregnancies, as well as
            foster an increased connection between parent and unborn child. Through
            various visualisation and digital fabrication techniques, we aimed to
            provide parents with a new way to connect with their babies, using methods
            such mesh extrapolation from 2D ultrasound images, allowing 3D printed tangible
            models to be produced.
            +++
            Access to the anonymised data obtained through this process also allowed
            us to investigate how machine learning can be used to pick up and point
            out potential anomalies to radiologists, reducing the high rate of ultrasound
            anomalies that currently go undetected.

            Teenyco won the $10,000 CMB Capital 'Best Startup' award at the Wade
            Institute's Final Pitch Night, as chosen by a panel including venture
            capitalists and established entrepreneurs.
