            In early 2020, I was promoted to Senior Engineer, alongside responsibilities as
            a Delivery Lead. As a product organisation, we have explored and adapted the Shape
            Up methodology to suit our company. As a Delivery Lead working within this methodology,
            I coordinate a team of engineers to see a 'shaped' idea through from pitch to delivery.

            I also continue to contribute to the Site Reliability Engineering practice, including
            internal infrastructure tooling and a construct library built with AWS's Cloud Development
            Kit (CDK).

            I started off working on the Collective Intelligence team to draw out insights
            from the results of our customer's surveys, to help those customers collect,
            share and act on employee feedback. This included a responsibility for deploying
            theoretical algorithms and frameworks developed by Data Scientists into
            production-quality and operational code, and for designing and delivering
            machine learning components of our product.

            From early 2019, I was Team Lead of the Comments team, responsible for all
            analytics and reporting related to comments left in the Culture Amp platform. In
            addition to leading a team of six, I contributed to the development of numerous
            new features, including comment clustering and automatic comment translation. I
            was also responsible for the infrastructure of the team's services.

            Teenyco aims to improve ultrasound diagnostics in pregnancies, as well as
            foster an increased connection between parent and unborn child. Through
            various visualisation and digital fabrication techniques, we are able to
            provide parents with a new way to connect with their babies. These methods
            include extrapolating meshes from 2D ultrasound images, allowing us to
            3D print tangible models.
            +++
            Access to the anonymised data obtained through this process also allows
            us to investigate how machine learning can be used to pick up and point
            out potential anomalies to radiologists, reducing the high rate of ultrasound
            anomalies that currently go undetected.
            +++
            Teenyco won the $10,000 CMB Capital 'Best Startup' award at the Wade
            Institute's Final Pitch Night, as chosen by a panel including venture
            capitalists and established entrepreneurs.

            meet up, and handles reviewing and payments (through the Stripe API) once
            the tutorial is completed.

            In these positions, I have worked with the cast and crew of over a dozen productions,
            developing my leadership and interpersonal skills, as well as my ability to navigate
            complex issues in a team. The diverse interests and individuals involved in artistic
            teams often create difficult scenarios, which require careful leadership and creative
            solutions. I have found the skills these experiences have given me complement my
            technical leadership well.
